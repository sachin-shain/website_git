        <p> Dear friends,</p>

        <p>MARTHOMEX 2025, with the theme “Where Roots Speak, the Future
          Listens”, brings together the fields of science, technology, arts, history,
          culture, and sports, sharing possibilities that lead to the holistic development of students. Our goal is to
          help students pursuing higher education understand the possibilities of new academic transformations in the
          higher education sector of Kerala. The expo highlights the honoring of
          Perumbavoor G. Raveendranath, the maestro who made deep imprints in
          the arena of music. Renowned dancer and actor Smt. Asha Sharath, our
          alumnus, will elegantize the occasion with an awe-inspiring performance
          in the Valedictory Function. We believe a college should grow with its
          community and we would love you to be a part of that growth by joining
          us for MARTHOMEX 2K25. A warm welcome to all.</p>

        <p id="regards">With regards,</p>
